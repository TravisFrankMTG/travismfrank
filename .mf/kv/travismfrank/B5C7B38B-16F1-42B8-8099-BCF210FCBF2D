# Orchestrating a New Musical: Instrumentation and Setup (Updated 2020)
Hey there!  It’s been a while since I updated this blog- nearly four years, in fact.  What’s up with that?  To be transparent, the end of 2016 was an incredibly busy moment in my life, and when life returned to a more manageable pace, maintaining this blog had fallen off of my radar.  But I’m back now!

A couple of factors have led to me returning to this project.  The elephant in the room, COVID-19, is chief among them.  As theatrical life has ground to a halt for me and the rest of the industry, I have been without my usual music direction and coaching work.  Some orchestration and arranging work has continued, but I have been on the hunt for projects that I can develop regardless of the current state of the world.  The push I needed to resume writing came from Holly Reed at [musicalwriters.com](http://musicalwriters.com).  Holly reached out to ask if I’d be interested in sharing my writing with their community, and that opportunity was all it took.  

So.  Here I am, back and better than ever.  I am going to begin by reworking my original “Orchestrating a New Musical” series.  I’ll leave up all of my old posts, for posterity, but in the intervening years I’ve grown as an orchestrator, music director, and writer.  Once I’ve had the chance to update some of my most popular posts, new content will be coming.

Whether you’re joining me for the first time or you were a reader all those years ago, thank you.  I’d love to hear from you.  Feel free to contact me with any comments or criticism.  Let’s get started.

## What Is Orchestration?
I believe it is prudent to define what exactly Orchestrating a New Musical means before we dive in.  For some this may seem obvious.  But for others this may be murky water, so hang tight.

Orchestrating a New Musical refers to the process of taking the score of a new musical and expanding and arranging it to be played by an entire orchestra or band.  Orchestrating is most often done by a separate specialist, the orchestrator, rather than the composer, and I will be writing from the perspective of an orchestrator that was not the composer of the music.  This is usually done because the composer of a new musical is already knees-deep in the process of writing and editing the show as rehearsals go on, and does not have the time to orchestrate their own material.  The craft is also rather different from composing, so from an artistic perspective it often makes sense as well.

The orchestrator has to be a chameleon; they may be required to orchestrate a rock song followed by a 1920’s big-band jazz piece.  Throughout this series of articles, I hope the one key takeaway is this: versatility and expertise in craft are the most important tools of any orchestrator.  If you are versed in a wide repertoire of music, you can bring stylistic choices and flair to your work.

Being a “well-read” orchestrator means actively listening to music.  How is the rhythm section’s groove locking in?  When do the strings enter, and why that moment?  What are the elements of this tune that stand out to the average listener?  What makes this song’s groove unique?  Asking these questions is so important to the craft of orchestration that at the end of each post in this series, I will provide a listening guide along with some prompts to help you examine the tunes critically.

## First Analysis
When you (the orchestrator) first get hired to orchestrate a new musical, what happens?  Hopefully you’re quickly introduced to the composer and lyricist, and then you go from there.

I find that the most helpful thing to do first is to comb through the score on your own, without the input of the composer and/or lyricist.  Simply read through it, perhaps play the piano part (if there is one).  Get to know the style and tone of the show.  _Then_, after you have made your own impressions, work with the composer and lyricist to get to the musical heart of the show.  They may have a very clear vision for the show, and present you with a complete instrumentation and suggestions for each song.  Or they may be completely clueless, preferring instead for you to do all of the heavy lifting.  Both of these situations are fine.

If the writers are pushy, and have pre-conceived ideas about what their show should sound like, listen to them, but always filter their demands through your experience and expertise.  If they don’t know what they want, that’s your cue to step up and make suggestions.  Always remember to work _with_ the writers, not against them.

## Instrumentation and Setup
The input from the writers feeds directly into the decision of instrumentation, the next step in preparing to orchestrate.  Instrumentation is the art of selecting which instruments will be present in the pit band of a new musical.

Oftentimes instrumentation is chosen out of necessity.  At the amateur and even semi-professional level, instrumentation is based on what players will be available for the production.  If the team can only put together a pianist, guitarist, drummer, and oboist, that’s your orchestra.  Similarly, if you want a 100-piece romantic orchestra, and the producer can only pay for a 20-piece orchestra (a sight I’d love to see), you can only have 20 players.  Essentially, resources, even more than artistic choices, dictate the instrumentation of the orchestra.

There are a variety of instrumentations that all work, and the choice really depends on the show and the style of the show.  For a rock-pop musical, one might want to put together a tight, groovin’ band that consists solely of:

-   Piano / Conductor
-   Acoustic / Electric Guitar
-   Electric Bass
-   Drum Kit
-   Keyboard 2
    

That’s a pretty small pit, but with the right players, that can be all you need.  After all, that’s more or less the instrumentation of most modern pop-rock bands.  Or, if a musical is looking to evoke the huge, roaring swing bands of the 30s, the orchestra might look more like this:

-   Piano / Conductor
-   Acoustic Bass
-   Hollow-Bodied Electric Guitar
-   Drum Kit
-   Alto Sax / Tenor Sax / Flute / Piccolo
-   Alto Sax / Clarinet / Oboe
-   Tenor Sax / Bari Sax / Clarinet / Bass Clarinet
-   Trumpet 1
-   Trumpet 2
-   Trombone 1
-   Trombone 2
    

Both of these bands can sound incredible and create beautiful music, but they obviously won’t create the same music.

An aside about doubling: as you may have noticed in the above lists, some players possess multiple instruments.  This is referred to as “doubling”.  In general, woodwind and rhythm section players are usually the only players asked to double, and nearly always on “like” instruments, though there are always exceptions.  For example, an alto sax player might be asked to play tenor sax and clarinet as well, or a guitarist might be asked to play steel-string acoustic guitar, nylon acoustic guitar, electric guitar, and mandolin.  Do note that doubling (rightfully) demands a higher fee for the player.  I will explore doubling in more depth as we examine each of the sections of the orchestra in detail.

Once you’ve nailed down the instrumentation, the next step is to set everything up so that you’re ready for writing.  I do everything electronically, but others find good old fashioned paper and pencil to be more therapeutic.  Regardless, creating a template is the next step.  Make sure that the show title, composer, lyricist, orchestrator, instrument names and abbreviations, copyright, and other relevant markings are present on the title page of each tune, with additional running headers throughout.  I won’t delve deeply into the world of music copying in this article, but I may be persuaded to write about the topic in the future.

After instrumentation has been chosen and your template has been created you’re all set to go!  We’ll go over the rhythm section next time when we revisit Orchestrating a New Musical.
